## Project Details

### Light/Dark Mode

The light/dark mode toggle allows users to switch between themes. The current mode is stored and updated dynamically.

### Product Display

The product display section showcases jerseys of famous soccer players. Users can switch between players using buttons, and only one player's jersey is displayed at a time.

### Guessing Game

In the guessing game section, users can enter a number between 1 and 10. The game generates a random number and compares it with the user's guess, displaying the result accordingly.

### Contact Form

The contact form collects the user's full name, phone number, email address, comments, and preferred contact method. It validates the input fields and displays error messages next to the inputs if any validation fails. On successful submission, the form data is displayed, and the form resets.
